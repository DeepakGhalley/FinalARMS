     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[mstWaterConnection].[solidWaste] on table [dbo].[mstWaterConnection] must be added, but the column has
         no default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid
         this issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation
         of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
